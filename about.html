        <div class="about"><p>Alex Melville is a designer and illustrator born out of Plainfield, Illinois who works under the pseudonym Skelly. Currently, he is working towards his BFA in graphic design at Illinois State University. Alex previously attended Joliet Junior College where his creative path began to blossom and he received his Associates of Science in graphic design. In his time there, he formed many connections which allowed him the opportunity to create the branding for "The Downward Dog" yoga company as well as flyers that advertise the Fine Arts Department to other high schools and possible incoming students. Alex is interested in combining skate culture with his illustrations to create a unique grungy feel that belongs on a T-shirt or Skateboard for his brand connected to his identity.
